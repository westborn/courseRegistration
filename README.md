# Course Regisation for U3A

This is a the basis of the tools built with Google Apps Script to manage the U3A course registation process

## 1. How to setup from scratch

### Initially setup a project using Node Package Manager (npm)

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save @types/google-apps-script
clasp clone [your script ID]
```

### Initialize GIT to manage source contrtol

```bash
git init
git add . -n
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Upload from manual project"
```

#### Go to github.

- Log in to your account.
- Click the new repository button in the top-right.
- You’ll have an option there to initialize the repository with a README file, but I don’t.
- Click the “Create repository” button.

```bash
git remote add origin [info copied from github]
git push origin master
```
